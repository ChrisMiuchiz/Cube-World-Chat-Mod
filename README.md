# Cube World Chat Mod

## Overview

Although Cube World has a chat box, chat is not implemented into multiplayer, as you will be the only one who can see your messages. This mod implements chat into multiplayer.

## Installation

1. Set up [Cube World Mod Launcher](https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz/Cube-World-Mod-Launcher/blob/master/README.md).

2. Get the latest .dll from [Releases](https://github.com/ChrisMiuchiz/Cube-World-Chat-Mod/releases) and put it in the `Mods` folder referenced in the setup of the mod launcher.
